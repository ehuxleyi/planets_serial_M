To run this serial version of the Planets model, follow these 4 steps:

1. use 7-zip or similar to extract the contents of "planets_serial_M.z" in a directory

2. start MATLAB

3. in MATLAB, change the directory to where you extracted the files to in 1

4. enter the command "temperature_stability" in MATLAB's command window


Parameter values and settings can be edited in the file 'initialise.m'

This serial version runs single planets one after another, with full 
visualisation of climate feedbacks, perturbations and changes in planetary 
temperature through time.

If you do not have access to MATLAB then an equivalent version in Octave is 
also available.
